# Polar-Solar-idea. A northern-norwegian take on agrivolataics.
Placing the PV panels on snow. Melts the snow, prepares soil for forestgarden planting.
This cools the panels too and should mean higher PV performance. Using the exess heat is crucial to the consept, as well as minimizing installation costs.

Should also work for knee-high closed greenhouses, although this setup will not get the same amount of cooling of the panels, but rather keep the plant temperature high.

Buy solar cells in bulk. My first try is a pacage of 100 regular blue cells from china. Total of 500 w for 1400 NOK.
Use two-layer used windows for houses, preferrably punctured ones. Drill hole in bottom side insulation and fill with water to get gas remains out. split bottom side of seal open with table saw or sometingh. slide in ready soldered solar matrix. I suppose stripped used installation cable will do the job for connections. Area and voltage calculations should be done for the window and PV cell specs in question. Letting light through between the cells is not a problem as the secondary use of the light is half the idea.
Once sunbaked enough to let out all steam, panel end i sealed with sealant and connectors are fitted. Probably crimped and fitted into 3D-printed housings.

For remote heating of buldings, this setup can be combined with the solar heater of Desert sun 2 on youtube.

This could work for all solar seasons and if neccessary, a heat exchanger could be placed in the heating loop.
Cheapest way would be a peltier element cooling the outside loop. Then two pumps would be needed and probably frost protection in the outside mix.
Still this house heating setup is the one I feel would be most benefitial for me in the start.
